            "A mutual fund is a pool of money managed by a professional Fund Manager.\n",
            "It is a trust that collects money from a number of investors who share a common investment objective and invests the same in equities, bonds, money market instruments and/or other securities. And the income / gains generated from this collective investment is distributed proportionately amongst the investors after deducting applicable expenses and levies, by calculating a scheme’s “Net Asset Value” or NAV. Simply put, the money pooled in by a large number of investors is what makes up a Mutual Fund.' metadata={'source': 'edufund.pdf', 'page': 0}\n",
            "page_content='Here’s a simple way to understand the concept of a Mutual Fund Unit. Let’s say that there is a box of 12 chocolates costing ₹40. Four friends decide to buy the same, but they have only ₹10 each and the shopkeeper only sells by the box. So the friends then decide to pool in ₹10 each and buy the box of 12 chocolates. Now based on their contribution, they each receive 3 chocolates or 3 units, if equated with Mutual Funds. And how do you calculate the cost of one unit? Simply divide the total amount with the total number of chocolates: 40/12 = 3.33. So if you were to multiply the number of units (3) with the cost per unit (3.33), you get the initial investment of ₹10.\n",
            "This results in each friend being a unit holder in the box of chocolates that is collectively owned by all of them, with each person being a part owner of the box.' metadata={'source': 'edufund.pdf', 'page': 0}\n",
            "page_content='This results in each friend being a unit holder in the box of chocolates that is collectively owned by all of them, with each person being a part owner of the box.\n",
            "Next, let us understand what is “Net Asset Value” or NAV. Just like an equity share has a traded price, a mutual fund unit has Net Asset Value per Unit. The NAV is the combined market value of the shares, bonds and securities held by a fund on any particular day (as reduced by permitted expenses and charges). NAV per Unit represents the market value of all the Units in a mutual fund scheme on a given day, net of all expenses and liabilities plus income accrued, divided by the outstanding number of Units in the scheme.' metadata={'source': 'edufund.pdf', 'page': 0}\n",
            "page_content='Mutual funds are ideal for investors who either lack large sums for investment, or for those who neither have the inclination nor the time to research the market, yet want to grow their wealth. The money collected in mutual funds is invested by professional fund managers in line with the scheme’s stated objective. In return, the fund house charges a small fee which is deducted from the investment. The fees charged by mutual funds are regulated and are subject to certain limits speciﬁed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).\n",
            "India has one of the highest savings rate globally. This penchant for wealth creation makes it necessary for Indian investors to look beyond the traditionally favoured bank FDs and gold towards mutual funds. However, lack of awareness has made mutual funds a less preferred investment avenue.' metadata={'source': 'edufund.pdf', 'page': 0}\n",

Hence, investors should do proper due diligence of the fund and take into consideration the risk-return trade-oﬀ and time horizon or consult a professional investment adviser.
